1. Understand the Application Structure
Break down the application into components. For a calculator app, you might have components like:
App: The main container.
Display: Shows the current input or result.
ButtonPanel: Contains all the calculator buttons.
Button: Represents a single button (e.g., numbers, operators).
2. Define Component Hierarchy
Identify the parent-child relationships between components. For example:
App → Display and ButtonPanel
ButtonPanel → Multiple Button components
3. Map Data Flow
Show how data flows between components:
Props: Data passed from parent to child.
State: Managed within a component and shared via props if needed.
Event Handlers: Functions passed to child components to handle user interactions.
4. Use Diagram Tools
Use tools like Draw.io, Figma, or Lucidchart to create the diagram.
Alternatively, you can sketch it on paper or use ASCII art for a simple representation.
